# TODO:
#
# 1) Allow "insert" and "replace" functionality for several selections,
#    including multirow selections.
#    (NOTE: make "insert" and "replace" functions to insert text if there are
#    several selections. See function rs_get_selection_text() parameter
#    `selection` for details).
#
# 2) Add unit tests:
#    a) create several contexts to be used in unit testing;
#    b) create actual tests where possible.
#
# 3) Remove:
#    a) ambiguous functions;
#    b) functions that are not used in any package;
#    c) unnecessary/ambiguous functionality (lines of code, parameters).
#
# 4) Check if deprecated functions still exist in other packages before removing
#    them.
